          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. </p><p>It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>

 <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p><p> Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
 <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). </p>
